      What inspired me to make this piece was an earlier project I made in my
      senior year of high school. As a final project, I use all my graphic
      design skills to create a comic book-like art piece that resembled
      something like an action scene or portrait of the hero with bright lines
      in the background as he fights and jumps around. Thus, creating the
      drawing machine. As you draw, you may see a resemblance to lasers or an
      explosion. Which was what was the direction I was going. I also choose the
      color red because the drawing machine looks like a video game I played
      before that incorporated a ton of red and black.
